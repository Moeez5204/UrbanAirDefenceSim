City model reconstruct

1 - download data
2 - process with geodata frame
    give height and zone
3 - Create synethic lahore
    np.linespace - create rando buildings
4 - building dictionary

Alpha complex reconstruct

1 - get 8 random points from roof and 2 from ground
2 - long/lang to meters
3 - alpha complex
    computes at different alpha points
    finds holes
    keeps going till triangles appear
    death alpha - birth alpha = persistance
4 - simplex tree
    analyze holes with the persistance

5 - visualize with gudhi
    3d point cloud visualization
    persistance diagram
    featue summary

persistance homology

1 - load data
2 - analyize persistnace
3 - seperate primary and secoundary canyons
4 - calc defenced suitablity metric

strategic feature extractiin

1 - load features
2 - find optimal navigation features\
